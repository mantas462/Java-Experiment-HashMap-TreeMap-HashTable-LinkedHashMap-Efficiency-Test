Hi there!

So I did a test where I was comparing efficiency between HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap and HashTable. For every structure I was using the same action: put 2000 elements in each array, sorted it and finally I printed them. Change branche to see more code. The results:

DATA STRUCTURE - NANOSEC, MILISEC, SEC

HashMap - 424308200, 4243,4
TreeMap - 4501331100,4501,4
LinkedHashMap - 4270695600,4270,4
HashTable - 4229389600,4229,4
